Poker Kata Project

This project contains 3 files: Hand.java, Card.java, and CompareHand.java.
You can pass input to the program through the command line, either directly or with a file.
The input must be in the form Name1: C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 Name2: C1 C2 C3 C4 C5. I ran it on Windows8 with:
java -cp . CompareHands Black: 2H 4D 5S 9C KD White: 2D 3H 5C KS KH. This will compare the 2 hands and be done.
Or you can pass a file(i have included a test.txt file with test cases):
java -cp . Comparehands test.txt.
